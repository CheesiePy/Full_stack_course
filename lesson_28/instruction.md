#### Instructions:

1. modify the `login.html` file to include a form with a username and password field. The form should also have a submit button. The form should have an action of `/login` and a method of `POST`.

2. modify "index.html" to include a link to the login page.

3. create a `login()` function in `script.js` to check the username and password against the database. (`data_base.json`) If the username and password are correct, redirect the user to the home page. If the username and password are incorrect, redirect the user to the login page.

4. after logging in, the user should see a welcome message on the home page(index.html) with the `prty.svg` image as background. The welcome message should include the user's username.
