## HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

It is a protocol for transmitting data over the web. When you enter a web address into your browser's address bar and hit enter, your computer sends an HTTP request to the web server that the website is hosted on. The server then responds with an HTTP response, which contains the content of the website (e.g. text, images, etc.) that you requested.

HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that the server does not remember anything about the client between requests. This means that the server does not know who you are, what you have done on the website, or what you have previously viewed. This is why you have to log in to a website every time you visit it.


### An HTTP request consists of a few different parts:

1. A request line, which contains the HTTP method (e.g. GET, POST, PUT), the path to the resource being requested (e.g. /index.html), and the HTTP version (e.g. HTTP/1.1).

2. A set of headers, which provide additional information about the request (e.g. the type of content being accepted by the client, the client's preferred language, etc.).

3. An optional message body, which can contain data being sent to the server (e.g. form data when submitting a form).

### Here is an example of an HTTP GET request:

```
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
Accept-Language: en-US
```

### An HTTP response consists of a few different parts:

1. A status line, which contains the HTTP version (e.g. HTTP/1.1), the status code (e.g. 200), and the status message (e.g. OK).
2. A set of headers, which provide additional information about the response (e.g. the type of content being sent by the server, the server's preferred language, etc.).
3. An optional message body, which can contain data being sent to the client (e.g. the HTML content of a web page).
