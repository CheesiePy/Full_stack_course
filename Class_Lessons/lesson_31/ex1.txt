So, how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? Well, a New York state wildlife expert, Richard Thomas, decided to answer that question some years back. He found that, while a woodchuck doesnâ€™t actually chuck wood, they do in fact chuck quite a bit of dirt when digging out a burrow. On a good day they can chuck around 35 cubic feet of dirt (or about 700 pounds). So it is perhaps reasonable to assume that if those furry little paws could chuck wood, a motivated woodchuck could do some serious damage to the neighborhood.
